## Project #2: KPK Car Dealership
A high-level overview of the project purpose:

### Situation
- KPK Car Dealership is a deployed, full stack application created for the Backend module of the Multiverse curriculum. KPK Car Dealership's main concept is a mock car dealership website that has car inventory as its main rendered data. Its main features and implementations are pagination, search, filter, user vs admin rights, RESTful API, Auth0, authorization, authentication, form validation, protected endpoints, middleware, and hashing.

### Task
- There are multiple core parts to the root project structure: `client`, `db`, `src`, and the files pertaining to connecting the SQLlite database, endpoints, and middleware.
- The design was mainly focused on the backend codebase, but my team and I created wireframes of the frontend components of how and where to render the data and other features of our application. 

### Action
- My main contributions revolved frontend and backend development.
- Frontend Implementations 
    - React, JS , HTML and CSS (including holo background) code for homepage (where login and signup forms live)
    - Bootstrap components for forms (style, banners, icons)
    - Login and Sign Up Form form validation with `Yup` package
    - Loading animation and functionality
    - Entire code in `client/components/buttons`

    - Code in `client/App.js`, `client/index.html`, `client/index.js`, `client/style.css`
    - Contribute to Admin, User, and Car models  in `db`
    - Contribute to initializing sequelize, connecting the database, and seeding the data in `db/db.js`, `db/index.js`, `db/seed.js`, `db/seedFn.js`, `server.js`
    - client side and server side connection
    - Initialize react files to setup a React application in `src/App.js`, `src/index.js`, `src/style.css`
    - Contribute the code within `src/components/buttons`, `src/components`
- Backend Implementations
    - Connect login and sign up form to the backend 
    - Contribute to admin logic and functionality in `index.js`
    - Contribute to the backend routes, protected endpoints, and logic in `index.js`   
- Auth0/Authentication
    - Implement Auth0 configuration in `client/App.js`

## Competencies
### JF 1.5
- Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software
- I worked independently, pair programmed, and worked with my team of 3 to produce software. Some actions I have taken to complete this job function is take initiative during meetings on how to start the SDLC process for the project. I would ask others to take lead on tasks, ask if they are okay with the task and if they have any concerns or questions. I would take lead on tasks and be a willing support developer on other team memeber's task they are leading on. I created a Slack group chat to check-in with my teammates and set up meetings outside of scheduled meeting times to complete the necessary tasks before the deadline (made sure this was okay with everyone before proceeding). 

### JF 2.1
- Can create and analyze artefacts, such as use cases and/or user stories
- While implementing code for the endpoints, I thought of common and extreme use cases that could be possible while a user is in the application. One example is with logging in and logging out. What is a user wants to type in the endpoint `/home` in the address bar, and is not logged in? Accessing this endpoint on the browser is only accessible after authenticating the user aka logging in. If the user wants to use the browser backspace or forward arrows to access the other services in the webpage after logging out, that isn't possible of the security code implemented.
- Another user story is user vs admin rights. If a user has admin priviledges, that user has access to services and functionality a user (such as a customer) does not have access to. For example, admin can edit/update car inventory, car prices, images, delete data and so on. By identifying this user story, we can plan out the code needed to make this possible. 
- Through the power of establishing use cases and user stories, we can plan and prevent a user hacking or using the website in a way that was not intended. 

### JF 2.6
- Can translate wireframes into User Interfaces
- In the design process, I created wireframes with Figma to translate them into User Interfaces. Much of my contributions are related to the frontend, creating React Components, state, other React code, CSS, and Bootstrap code that reflect the wireframes. In relation to the project, translating the wireframes to the UI meant everyone on the team knew what the end product should look like and create code that adds functionality that makes sense to the User Interface.

### JF 3.6
- Can implement a RESTful API ([resource: WHat is a REST API?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api))
- I followed the software architecture that makes an API RESTful:
    - A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed through HTTP
    - Stateless client-server communication
    - Cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions
    - A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standard form
- In `index.js`, multiple HTTP Methods were used for all endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- HTTP authentication was also used with Bearer authentication, the process of giving access control to the token bearer
- The use of Postman was heavily used to make sure the RESTful API was successful and each request had a successful response, or if there was n error, proper error handling

### JF 4.3
- Is able to build, manage and deploy code into the relevant environment
- I took lead on and contributing member of many core parts of building and managing the codebase. Examples include writing the initial React code and components, login, register form and functionality and code pertaining to the database - initializing, connecting, rendering, secure sensitive and personal data.


### JF 4.4
- Can interpret and implement a given design while remaining compliant with security and maintainability requirements	
- With our design, the team needed a functionality to register, login, logout, and all other endpoints. With that in mind, we were compliant with security and maintainability requirements by adding middleware to protect all endpoints with the use of access and refresh tokens. CI is helpful so we can be aware when tests are passing and failing and we can debug when necessary. 


### JF 5.5
- Understands and can apply structured techniques to problem solving, can debug code and can understand the structure of programmes to identify and resolve issues
- My general technique to problem solving is asking myself what is the problem in the first place and what is my goal to get to the solution. If it is debugging, I look at the error messages or a `console.log()`, and play around with the code. If it is adding a feature, I do my research and look up resources such as documentation, videos, etc. I also do this with debugging. I then lean to my colleagues for help and get their input. In terms of High Paw, I used this general process to code. For example, when I want to implement refresh and access tokens, I looked at resources on how to implement these tokens with MongoDB. Knowing how and what to search on Google or the internet is an essential skill to problem solve. 


### JF 6.4
- Works independently and takes responsibility. For example, has a disciplined and responsible approach to risk, and stays motivated and committed when facing challenges							
- A lot of my time working on the codebase was independent work. For example, I was tasked with the profile feature and CI/CD. I was responsible with implementing the code to complete the tasks, problem-solved, and debugged when I need to. I stayed motivated and disciplined to the tasks at hand without the need of someone to be with me. When writing the code for the profile endpoints, adding the middleware for protections, I check all of the possible common and uncommon use cases. I add error handling to help me figure out the issue when something is wrong. Before checking-in with my teammate, if I am stuck on a problem, I would have my organized notes to relay all the issues I have faced and the steps I have already taken. I am also responsible as a team member, I check-in with my backend partner and the other 2 teammates responsible for the front-end. We meet up outside the scheduled time to plan out the features within the deadline given to us. On the week before the presentation, I was on vacation. I did not want my backend partner to be overwhelmed with the work so I took it upon myself to work on the project outside of work to make sure my team is not burdened due to my absence. 

### JF 6.6
- Shows initiative for solving problems within their own remit, being resourceful when faced with a problem to solve				
- The greatest example that shows my initiative to solve problems was when there was a huge issue with deployment and Redis. I initially used Redis as an in-memory keyâ€“value database for the refresh tokens. Unfortunately, Redis was giving issues for deployment, and after a week of working on it, plus leaving for vacation, after consulting with my team, we decided to remove Redis from the codebase and use MongoDB instead. We needed to add another model, and implementation on all of the necessary endpoints, middleware, functions, etc. Sometimes, problem-solving is being smart with time-management and being resourceful to look for other solutions that may not have been originally planned.
