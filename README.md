## Portfolio Introduction
Heya üëãüèª, I'm Kharmalina! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer Apprentice at Verizon. Why do I love to code? I have a passion for creation and go through the entire Software Development Life Cycle - from idea and design to implemenation and deployment. 

I enjoy my work come to life and see the impacts it has on its users. Throughout the apprenticeship, I have worked with 3-4 developers at a time working on projects that have a main goal in mind, focusing on frontend, backend, fullstack implementation and deployment. At Verizon, I used my skills learned from Multiverse and on the job to update and build features for my team. I have a special interest in frontend development and design, but I enjoy building full stack applications and contribute to the SDLC.
